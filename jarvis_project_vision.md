## 3. Conceptual Architecture

Jarvis is envisioned as a system with several key conceptual layers:

1.  **User Interface:** A clean, responsive web interface providing the primary point of interaction for both voice and text. It prioritizes clarity and ease of use.
2.  **Interaction Engine:** Manages the real-time communication flow, enabling low-latency speech processing, text chat, and smooth transitions between modes. It ensures the conversation feels natural and responsive.
3.  **Orchestration Core:** The central "brain" of Jarvis. It interprets user intent, manages the conversational state, decides whether to respond directly or delegate tasks, and oversees the agent system.
4.  **Agent Framework:** A flexible system housing various specialized AI agents. These agents are invoked by the Orchestration Core to perform specific functions like research, data analysis, planning, or using external tools.
5.  **Tool & Knowledge Access:** Mechanisms allowing Jarvis and its agents to securely connect to and utilize external resources like search engines, APIs, local files, and internal knowledge bases (including memory).
6.  **External Connectivity:** Systems to enable secure access beyond the local network and integration with external services.

**Interaction Philosophy:** Simple requests are handled instantly by the core. Complex tasks trigger a seamless handoff to the agent framework, which works autonomously to fulfill the request, providing updates or requesting clarification as needed, all orchestrated behind the scenes.

## 4. Core Capabilities (The "What")
